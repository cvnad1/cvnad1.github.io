                <h3>Diversity Enhacing Recommender System</h3>
                <p style="font-family: verdana; text-align: justify;">
                    A Recommender system which takes the plays of the friends in the network of user and recommends
                    the music or genre that the user does not listen to often. In this way, the recommender system indirectly
                    diversifies the user as well as help independent artists to gain more exposure to their music.
                    Includes Dashboard for user analytics for a song by a artist and
                    a unique collobaration dashboard based on artist genre of music and influencers who use the artist's music.
                    These two dashboards help the music artist to get data on what interests his users and who are the influencers who
                    use the music so that the artist can have possible collaborations with these influencers.

                <h3>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Career</h3>
                <p style="font-family: verdana; text-align: justify;">
                    Created a RAG system with three vector stores which anlyzes the student's resume, job description, and other information
                    provided by the early career students at any university. The system compares the projects, experience, keywords, skills,
                    and summary with the vision/mission statement, job responsibilities, requirements, and other sections to give detailed
                    score for each of job responsibilities match, skill match, mission/vision match, action keyword match, and other keywords match.
                    All of these scores are calculated with reference to previous successful candidates who were aiming to get similar jobs at smilar stages
                    of career from the same university the user belongs. This application removes unfair bias in comparison between applicants for generating such scores, 
                    eases out career services at each university, and helps students in navigating their careers.

                <h3>Stance Detection</h3>
                <p  style="font-family: verdana; text-align: justify;">
                    Implemented Stance Detection including text processing and model training/inference scripts 
                    on Sem-eval 2016 dataset. Used BERT, and ELECTRA to produce embeddings of the sentence. 
                    Utilized SVM and LSTM as classifier heads.
